- Here I'm working on my personal portfolio as a full stack developer with various web technologies. I'm primarily will be focusing on developing microservices code since that's what I intend to do in the next couple of months on my new project. I will be pushing some generic code that can be utilized anywhere, so it can be used by public. Hoping to create some sort of an open source project.
